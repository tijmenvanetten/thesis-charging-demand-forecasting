# Charging Demand Forecasting
Introduction

## Abstract 
  
## Datasets

## Requirements

The code uses the Darts library for time series forecasting. Dependencies can be installed via pip:
```setup

1. Create a new environment
   ```setup
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
2. Activate the environment
   ```setup
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
3. Install the requirements within the environment via pip:
   ```setup
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Code Structure

The code is split into three main parts by folders:
* [data](data/) contains the raw and preprocessed data for the experiments.
* [src](src/) 
* [experiments](experiments/) includes the task-specific code for the three different experiments.
* [data_analysis](data_analysis/)
